# Dot files

### Use Case:
New computer setup or wanting local configuration on remote ssh server

### What is liked_themes.txt?
[Oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) has a lot of really cool in-built themes. 
`liked_themes.txt` is simply the themes I like saved for later use.

`.zshrc` has a few commands to pick a random theme of the ones I like,
located in `liked_themes.txt` when the shell loads.
