# Dot files
.zhsrc .bashrc .tmux.conf

## Use Case:
New computer setup or wanting local configuration on remote ssh server

## What is liked_themes.txt?
Oh my zsh: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh has a lot of really cool in-built themes. 
I had these on 'RANDOM' for a couple of weeks while using the terminal everyday. 
During this time I collected the names of the themes that I was a fan of.

I've now added a few commands to .zshrc that will pick a random theme of the ones I like,
located in "liked_themes.txt" when the shell loads.

## TODO:
- Figure out better interaction between vim and tmux
- Work on clean installations on Linux & OSX environments to test plugin dependencies
